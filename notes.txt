I think the yield from self._run_gen in run_gen is timeslicing the function and every time it returns it's timed out

score object interactions is slow

scoring object aops is slow as it tests every interaction on each potential object

hierarchial interactions?

for sim that needs to have autonomy run:
    get each need that needs to be satisfied
    if there are needs to be satisfied:
            for each object in the world that satisfies at least one need:
                for each interaction on the object:
                    score the interaction
                    test if the interaction can run
    
    :somewhat random interaction with the highest score gets selected as the interaction
